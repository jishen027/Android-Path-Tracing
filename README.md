# Software Development for Mobile Devices

## University of Sheffield COM6501

## Description
The application is a city-based travel application consisting of an images or photo display of attractions and places of interests around a city (Sheffield, London,  Manchester, etc.) you have visited or been to. You are able to receive and edit relevant information about the images on mobile device and to organise them along geolocated visits.

The app will alow to :
1. Map integration and Taking photos: Taking pictures and allowing pictures to be uploaded to the map.
2.  Capturing a visit and Trip planning: using sensors and locating the user using the phone’s  location services; during a visit it must be possible to take pictures that are then associated to  the path and its sensor readings. 
3.  Visually browse previews of photos: stored in the phone’s photo library (gallery) using a number of strategies.
4.   Saving the pictures and metadata to local Room database.
5.   Inspect the details of a photo (both the full photo in itself and its metadata, i.e. geolocation, description, title, etc). The user must be able to edit and persist the metadata.
6.   Showing details of a photo including its location on a map and the details of the path the picture is part of.
7.   Implementing any additional functionalities (weather forecast pinned upon the map,  search location by photos, rating and recommendations, etc.)

## Feature List
1. to build an app with a flexible sophisticated layout
2. to use separation of concerns (using MVVM)
3. to cope with multimedia data
4. to store data locally using abstractions of databases (Rooms)
5. to use the phone’s sensors (GPS, barometric pressure, etc.)
6. to use background services
